(Functional Prompt Questions)

How does this solution ensure data immutability?

- This solution ensures data immutability because with only append present data can only be added and not deleted.

Is this solution a pure function? Why or why not?

- Yes this function is pure because it doesnt have any side effects and only depends on the array.

Is this solution a higher order function? Why or why not?

- Yes, this is a solution is a higher order function because it accepts one or more functions as an argument.

Would it have been easier to solve this problem using a different programming style?

- I think it wouldn't be easier solving it with a different programming style. 

Why in particular is functional programming a helpful paradigm when solving this problem?

- Functional programing is helpful when solving this problem because it is easier to analyze and teste the code due to the fact that it is pure.





(Obeject-Oriented Prompt Questions)

How does this solution demonstrate the four pillars of OOP? (It may not demonstrate all of them, describe only those that apply)
Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism

- This code demonstrated Encapsulation and inheritance due to the readability of the code. It also used Abstraction and Polymorphism because the code is very flexible, you can add and remove elements if you would like.

Would it have been easier to implement a solution to this problem using a different coding style? Why or why not?

- No, I think using the 4 pillars of OOP definately made the process easier becuase it was easier to organize the code.

How in particular did Object Oriented Programming assist in the solving of this problem?

- It made it easier to understand and to read for me. Visually it worked in my mind.




(Reflection)

Is one of these coding paradigms "better" than the other? Why or why not?

- No, I think each coding paradigms bring something different to the table that makes the process easier to execute.

Given the opportunity to work predominantly using either of these coding paradigms, which seems more appealing? Why?

- In my opinion, I would go with the 4 pillars of OOP because that was the easier for me to work with.

Now being more familiar with these coding paradigms, what tasks/features/pieces of logic would be best handled using functional programming? Object Oriented Programming?

- Functional prgramming would be suited for machine learning and analyzing extensive data sets. OOP is used for large complex projects such as mobile applications or manufacturing system simulation software.

Personally, which of these styles takes more work to understand? What should be done in order to deepen understanding related to this paradigm?

- Functional Programming and it will take more repetition to deepen my understanding.
